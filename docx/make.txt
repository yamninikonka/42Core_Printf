rule syntax:
------------
targets ...: prerequisites ...
	recipes ...
	...
	...
	...
=========================================================
there are types of rules
	static rule
	pattern rule

they behave differently with same rule syntax.
example: $< - it runs only once generally
		if pattern rule: runs for every pattern match
		if static rule: runs only for first file
